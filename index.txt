I have experience coding in R (through my internship project this summer, when analyzing company data), VBA (through ITM coursework), and SQL (through ITM coursework in SAD).
I expect to learn more about coding, specifically how different coding languages can work together to create a solution in a web platform.
An interesting thing about me is that I have two younger sisters and we were all born about a year apart from each other.
